# Tre Cool Beans
## Team Workflow

### Purpose

This repository is to hold all information pertaining to Tre Cool Beans' (TCB) team
workflow. It will also be used to hold anything else that TCB members find useful as a sort of library of shared knowledge.

### Contributing to this Repository

To contribute to this repository simply clone the git repo and begin modifying,
adding, removing, or changing things as you see fit. All work should be done on
the `master` branch and there should never be any other branches made. This method
will ensure that all information is consistent and does not get fragmented but always
check with the other TCB members before working in this repo so there is a minimum
of merge and rebase conflicts.
